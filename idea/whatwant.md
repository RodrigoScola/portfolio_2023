Hi! I’m Chris Chin, a full-stack web developer from Brazil. After working as an accountant for almost 7 years, I’ve decided to take the leap to pursue a career in software engineering. I’ve enrolled in a full-time immersive software engineering program at Fullstack Academy in NYC. Having just graduated from this rigorous program, I can say that applying to a coding bootcamp has been the best decision I have ever made in my life. I love to learn new technologies and flex my creativity to create amazing things.

## Design Guidelines

Modern design that is responsive and interactive like a slideshow, user just needs to scroll down or press a few buttons to get where they want, ie contact section
not that many catchy color variants, more different color schemas for each page.

- Being responsive and fast is a big deal.
